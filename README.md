Best for you reader! You happened to land on my humble GitHub profile. Welcome!

Who am I? Well, I am a physicist in training specialized in... agh... I am still trying to find out :). So far my GitHub profile is pretty empty. I recommend checking out my [bachelor thesis repository](https://github.com/Valentyk/My-bachelor-thesis) which has some interesting stuff going on in my opinion (a little bit of maths but the pretty images of functions on a three-dimensional sphere are worth it, I swear!). Hopefully, I will add my little side projects that will help me learn  coding/physics/maths and maybe help you (or entertain you :)) as well! So please enjoy.
